## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async/await support and SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Frontend**: Modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite with the vehicle processing schema
- **API Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger generation
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic models for type safety
- **Styling**: Professional gradient design with responsive layout
- **Icons**: Font Awesome icons for visual consistency

### API Endpoints
All endpoints include automatic documentation and validation:

- `GET /api/vehicles` - Paginated vehicle list with search (supports query parameters)
- `GET /api/vehicle/{vehicle_id}` - Detailed vehicle information  
- `GET /api/statistics` - Dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/recent-activity` - Recent processing activity (configurable limit)
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/docs` - Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI)
- `GET /api/redoc` - Alternative API documentation (ReDoc)

### Pydantic Models
Type-safe data structures ensure API reliability:
- `VehicleInfo` - Basic vehicle information for listings
- `VehicleDetail` - Complete vehicle details with all processing data
- `Statistics` - Dashboard statistics structure
- `ActivityItem` - Recent activity item structure
- `PaginationInfo` - Pagination metadata

### Data Sources
The dashboard reads from the `vehicle_processing.db` database created by the main automation system. It displays:
- Vehicle basic information (stock number, VIN, odometer)
- Processing results and timing
- Feature marking decisions
- Description updates
- NO FEAR certifications
- Error logs and diagnostics

## Customization

### Styling
- Modify `static/css/dashboard.css` to customize the appearance
- The design uses CSS custom properties for easy color scheme changes
- Responsive breakpoints are defined for mobile compatibility

### Functionality
- Add new API endpoints in `app.py`
- Extend the JavaScript dashboard class in `static/js/dashboard.js`
- Update the HTML template in `templates/dashboard.html`

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 70+
- Firefox 65+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Performance
- Pagination prevents loading large datasets
- Debounced search reduces API calls
- Responsive design optimizes mobile performance
